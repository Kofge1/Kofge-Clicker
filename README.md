# AutoClicker

A lightweight Windows auto clicker with profiles, hotkeys, humanized CPS, click patterns, tray status indicator and window targeting.

## Features

- Adjustable CPS from 1 to 100.
- Hold and Toggle modes.
- Left and right mouse button automation.
- Humanized clicking.
- Click patterns: Standard, Burst, Double and Hold+Burst.
- Rate behavior: Locked and Amplified.
- Profiles for saving and switching setups.
- Custom hotkeys for Panic Stop, Show Window and Toggle Power.
- Window targeting: click only while a selected app/window is active.
- Tray support with an ON/OFF status indicator.
- Settings, profiles and logs are stored in `%LocalAppData%\AutoClicker`, so the executable folder stays clean.
